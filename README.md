Big Scale Decision Making Tool

Nabú is a big scale decision tool for cooperative groups.
It starts from an objective and reflects constantly all the information people say, creating group consciousness.
The final purpose of Nabú is to write consensus documents. These documents are the result of everybody's opinion 
and the generators for real actions. To start a real action a consensus document is needed. Everybody can purpose 
a complete document at any time or just a part of it. All parts are represented in a tree (reflection method) 
so everybody can see the map of proposals at any time.

Documents are written en 5 levels from the root to the leaf. Starting with an introduction (more abstract part) 
to a budget-and-final-date (more concrete part).

When you start a new document at level 1, Nabú lets you select a document template from a list. So it is possible 
to start different types of document discussions.
When you see the tree you can find parts of documents that you are in agree with and parts that you don't. When you are 
in agree you can vote it putting a flower over that part so the branch become wider.

Opinions (parts of documents) are anonymous. This is a very important detail. When you say something to the group 
then it is not yours anymore. It is part of the group consciousness now.

* Rules of the game:
- Everybody has the same number of flowers
- When you propose something you spend one of your flowers
- When you vote something you spend one of your flowers
- You can change your flowers position at any time from one opinion to another
- You can recover a flower from one opinion at any time so you have one more flower available
- If you take out the last flower of one opinion, the branch dies so the tree can sprout again
- When you put a flower on an opinion the branch becomes wider. And thiner if you recover it.
- You always see your flowers in the tree but you cannot see flowers from other people.

* Reflection
- All opinions are in the reflection (tree nodes)
- All votes are in the reflection (wide of the branch)
- The tree changes all the time
- The tree is the living representation of the group consciousness

* Convergence or divergence
The most important learning about the tree is to see quickly documents that are converging and documents 
that are diverging. Convergence is near to consensus and divergence is far. In a cooperative group we need 
consensus documents to start real actions, so everybody wants to construct consensus document.

Consensus is a cooperative task
